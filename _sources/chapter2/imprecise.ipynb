    "### Imprecise probabilistic models of uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability boxes generalise probability distributions and intervals;\n",
    "they model a set of cumulative distribution functions. Probability boxes\n",
    "are used to communicate epistemic uncertainty in the precise form of a\n",
    "probability distribution {cite}`sandia2002constructing`. In the particular\n",
    "limiting cases of no epistemic uncertainty and no aleatory uncertainty,\n",
    "traditional CDFs and intervals can be recovered from the probability\n",
    "box, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, probability boxes can be split into two types.\n",
    "Distribution-free probability boxes consist of an envelope defined by\n",
    "two CDFs. Any CDF contained within the envelope is permitted, i.e. the\n",
    "probability box contains all cumulative distribution functions $F(x)$\n",
    "which satisfy the envelope condition\n",
    "$\\underline{F}(x) \\le F(x) \\le \\overline{F}(x) \\forall x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributional probability boxes consist of a conventional probability\n",
    "distribution where at least one parameter of the distribution is given\n",
    "as an interval rather than a crisp value, i.e. the probability box is\n",
    "given by the probability distribution $p_{\\theta}(x)$ with parameters\n",
    "$\\theta \\in \\Theta$, where $\\Theta$ is a hyper-rectangular convex set.\n",
    "It is possible to perform a conversion from distributional probability\n",
    "boxes to distribution-free probability boxes, by finding a\n",
    "distribution-free probability box which encloses the distributional\n",
    "probability box. This conversion results in the loss of information\n",
    "about the distribution types enclosed, and hence the conversion can not\n",
    "be easily reversed. The envelope of a distributional probability box,\n",
    "which will be a distribution-free probability box, can be obtained by\n",
    "evaluating \n",
    "\n",
    "$$[\\underline{F}(x), \\overline{F}(x)] = [\\min_\\theta{F_\\theta(x)}, \\max_\\theta{F_\\theta(x)}],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_\\theta(x)$ is the CDF corresponding to the probability\n",
    "distribution $p_\\theta(x)$.\n",

    "#### Computation with Probability Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability boxes are a specific case of a random set\n",
    "{cite}`de2015efficient`{cite}`alvarez2006calculation`, and therefore when they are\n",
    "propagated through a calculation their propagation can be decomposed\n",
    "into two distinct parts; the propagation of a set of epistemic uncertain\n",
    "variables which fall within an uncertain hyper-rectangle\n",
    "$\\theta \\in \\Theta$, and the propagation of an aleatory set of variables\n",
    "$\\alpha$, which are associated with a probability distribution. The\n",
    "result of propagation through the model is a probability box, rather\n",
    "than a single CDF. The propagation is non-trivial since the epistemic\n",
    "variables are intervals and have no probability distribution, which\n",
    "means that conventional Monte Carlo simulation cannot be applied. Two\n",
    "methods are commonly used to propagate probability boxes: Double Loop\n",
    "Monte Carlo (sometimes referred to as search or optimisation of the\n",
    "epistemic space), and integration of the aleatory variables\n",
    "{cite}`patelli2014uncertainty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a distributional probability box the upper and lower expectation are\n",
    "defined by\n",

    "similar approximation techniques to those discussed for probability\n",
    "distributions earlier in the chapter can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general case, to accurately approximate the upper expectation in\n",

    "the case of distributional probability boxes. This estimator can be\n",
    "shown to have a positive bias {cite}`troffaes2018imprecise`. As is the case\n",
    "with computation with interval models, it is necessary to use a\n",
    "non-linear optimisation routine to evaluate the outer loop in the\n",
    "general case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Double Loop Monte Carlo method can be modified to propagate\n",
    "distribution-free probability boxes by drawing the samples required for\n",
    "{eq}`eqn_double_loop_mc` from a monotonically increasing\n",
    "staircase function, which is parameterised by $\\theta$ and satisfies the\n",
    "envelope condition for the probability box under consideration. However,\n",
    "this approach will be computationally inefficient in general since a\n",
    "high dimensionality $\\theta$ would be required to approximate the\n",
    "probability box with sufficient accuracy, and therefore another approach\n",
    "is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a distribution-free probability box note that one can sample\n",
    "intervals from the probability box by generating random numbers between\n",
    "0 and 1 and applying inverse transform sampling to $\\overline{F}$ and\n",

    "envelopes and $\\mathcal{U}$ is the uniform distribution. The process of\n",
    "generating a single sample is known as taking the $\\alpha$ cut, and the\n",
    "sampled intervals constitute focal elements {cite}`de2015efficient`. This\n",
    "process is shown in {numref}`fig:alpha_cut`. One can then propagate these intervals\n",
    "through $g(x)$ using the techniques described for intervals in the\n",
    "previous section, e.g. using the natural interval extension of $g(x)$,\n",
    "or using black-box optimisation. Therefore one can calculate the upper\n",
