    "computations which can be performed with the model and the\n",
    "appropriateness of the model's representation of uncertainty. Engineers\n",
    "should also note that it is essential to exercise their judgement even\n",
    "after the theoretical uncertainty framework is chosen, since the set of\n",
    "hypotheses included in the uncertainty model has a strong affect on the\n",
    "conclusions drawn from analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following problem proposed by\n",

    "occur, for example if a set of events are predicted to occur with 0.9\n",
    "probability then we expect that they occur 90% of the time in reality.\n",
    "This can be verified by plotting the test data relative to the trained\n",
