Chapter summary
---------------

This chapter presents a review of regression models with predictive
uncertainty which can be used to describe the relationship between
variables in engineering models, in addition to describing how the
models can be created in practice from data. We reviewed probabilistic
models and non-probabilistic models. Probabilistic regression models use
probability distributions to express information about the variability
and uncertainty in the modelled output; they are currently the most
widely used regression models. Non-probabilistic models are useful in
cases where only limited or imprecise data may be available, and prior
knowledge of regression model parameters may be difficult to obtain. A
particular advantage of Convex IPMs are the aÂ priori bounds on the model
bound violation, which can be used to validate the model at training
time without test data.
