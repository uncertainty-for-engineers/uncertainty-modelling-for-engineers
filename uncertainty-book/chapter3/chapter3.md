Machine Learning of Regression Models
=====================================

Overview of regression models
-----------------------------

Regression models differ from generative uncertainty models in that they
model the effect of one variable on another variable. In the language of
probability theory this involves modelling a conditional probability
distribution, rather than a joint probability distribution. In some
fields regression models are known as discriminative models, but this is
usually when the dependent variable in the probability distribution is
discrete, and the problem to be solved involves classification
{cite}`ng2002discriminative`. This thesis is concentrated only on the case of
continuous variables. In this chapter, we review different classes of
regression model and describe how they can be trained and validated from
data. We describe in which circumstances each type of model should be
used.
