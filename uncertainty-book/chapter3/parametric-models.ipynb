    "Typically when learning a regression model, one wishes to obtain a\n",

    "It is common to define a probability distribution based on the output of\n",
    "a regression model, and then use the probability calculus introduced in\n",

    "of the distribution, e.g. the mean of a normal distribution:\n",
    "$p(y|x, \\boldsymbol{p}) =  \\mathcal{N}(f(x, \\boldsymbol{p}),\\,\\sigma^{2}),$\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the scale parameter of the normal distribution, which\n",
    "should be learned form data. This results in a model where the level of\n",
    "uncertainty in $p(y|x)$ does not depend on the input to the model. This\n",
    "is known as a homoscedastic model of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is desirable to explicitly allow the uncertainty in the\n",
    "predictions to depend on $x$. This is known as heteroscedastic\n",
    "uncertainty {cite}`gal2016uncertainty`. In this case it can be useful to\n",
    "define a model where other parameters of the distribution depend on $x$,\n",

    "different functions with different parameter sets, $\\boldsymbol{p}_1$\n",
    "and $\\boldsymbol{p}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any valid probability distribution can be used in a similar way, for\n",
    "example the Dirac delta function can be used to define\n",
    "$p(y|x, W, u) =  \\delta(y - f_{i}(x, u, W)),$ where $f_{i}(x)$ is the\n",

    "#### Computational methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the most common way to create regression models is to\n",
    "evaluate the estimators $\\boldsymbol{p}_\\text{ML}$ or\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{p}_\\text{MAP}$ with Stochastic Gradient Ascent, which\n",

    "the trainable parameter, i.e.\n",
    "$p_i \\gets p_i + \\eta \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_i}.$ This\n",
    "is repeated for a set number of iterations until the algorithm has\n",
    "converged. Stochastic Gradient Descent approximates the product of\n",
    "likelihoods in the loss function by evaluating the likelihood for one\n",
    "different sampled data point at each iteration. This is effective since\n",
    "the expectation of the loss used in Stochastic Gradient Descent will\n",
    "still be equal to the true value of the loss function. In this case, the\n",
    "learning rate constant must be reduced to ensure convergence, which\n",
    "means many iterations of the algorithm are required to ensure a good\n",
    "estimate for the parameters is obtained. Mini-batches, where the\n",
    "likelihood is evaluated for a small set of data points at each\n",
    "iteration, can be used to achieve good convergence at higher learning\n",

    "can be used {cite}`ruder2016overview`. Various improvements to Stochastic\n",
    "Gradient Descent aim to ensure that the optimiser reaches a true minimum\n",
    "of the loss function, a particularly common improvement being the ADAM\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimators can\n",
    "allow some estimate of the uncertainty in the model to be made, but this\n",
    "uncertainty is an underestimate of the true model uncertainty. For very\n",
    "simple regression models, MCMC can be used to obtain the full posterior\n",
    "distribution on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, however this is usually intractable\n",

    "The technique of dropout sampling has been shown to improve the\n",
    "performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent solvers, by improving the\n",
    "performance on validation tests {cite}`srivastava2014dropout`. Dropout\n",
    "sampling involves randomly setting a fraction, $p_\\text{dropout}$ of the\n",
    "weights to zero during each training iteration. For particular choices\n",
    "of activation function, when an $l_2$ penalty on the weights is used in\n",
    "the loss function, it can be shown that dropout sampling is equivalent\n",
    "to variational inference on a Bayesian neural network, where a Bernoulli\n",
    "distribution is used as the approximating posterior distribution\n",
    "{cite}`gal2016dropout`. In order for the approximating posterior distribution\n",
    "to be an accurate representation of the true posterior distribution, it\n",
    "is necessary to adjust the dropout probability, $p_\\text{dropout}$.\n",
    "Rather than repeatedly performing training with different dropout\n",
    "probabilities, it is more efficient to make the dropout probability a\n",
    "parameter which can be optimised during training, by making the loss\n",
    "differentiable in terms of the dropout probability. This can be achieved\n",
    "with concrete dropout, where a continuous approximation of the Bernoulli\n",
    "distribution is used {cite}`gal2017concrete`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "As was the case with generative uncertainty models in\n",
    "Chapter {ref}`ch:uncertainty_models`, it is necessary to validate\n",
    "Regression Models. For probabilistic regression models this involves\n",
    "many of the same techniques which are applied when validating generative\n",
    "models. However, validating conditional probability densities presents\n",
    "additional challenges; although the model's predicted probabilities may\n",
    "be correctly calibrated on average, the model may be overly certain in\n",
    "some areas of the input domain and too uncertain in other areas. For\n",
    "example, using a regression model with homoscedastic uncertainty on a\n",
    "dataset where the uncertainty is heteroscedastic may predict the correct\n",
    "mean squared error on average {cite}`gal_github`, but the model evidence will\n",
    "be lower than for a more appropriate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To briefly recap the content from\n",
    "{ref}`sec:validation_uq`, before training one should split the\n",
    "data into training and test data sets, and then begin the validation by\n",
    "applying sanity checks. For example, a posterior predictive check could\n",
    "be used, where data is sampled from the trained model and compared to\n",
    "the training data. Alternatively, one could produce a plot of the\n",
    "normalised residuals, where the difference between the model output and\n",
    "the training and test data divided by predicted standard deviation\n",
    "($\\frac{y-y^{(i)}}{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}_{p(y|x^{(i)})}(y)}}$) is\n",
    "plotted against the model output. Then more formal methods can be used,\n",
    "for example the Bayes factor can be computed as in\n",
    "{eq}`eqn:bayes_factor`, to compare several models\n",
    "{cite}`friedman2001elements`. This is similar to comparing the negative\n",
    "logarithmic predictive density of different models on the test sets,\n",
    "which is equal to the Mahalanobis distance for Gaussian predicted\n",
    "probability densities. It is essential to compare the value of the loss\n",
    "(the negative logarithmic predictive density) between the test and\n",
    "training data sets. If the value of the loss is much higher on the test\n",
    "data set it is likely that the model is over-fitting the data, and will\n",
    "not generalise well to new data. One may also wish to compute the\n",
    "expected variance of the Model's predictions\n",
    "($\\int{ \\operatorname{Var}_{p(y|x)}(y) p(x) dx}$), as it is likely that\n",
    "this can be compared to the expected uncertainty of a subject matter\n",
    "expect in order to appraise the performance of the model. If the\n",
    "uncertainty is too high it is likely that the model is under-fitting the\n",
    "data so the model complexity should be increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The bias-variance tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian techniques rely upon priors to control the complexity of a\n",
    "regression model. Well chosen priors prevent learning too much\n",
    "information from a sample of data, and hence prevent overfitting by\n",
    "restricting the effective learning capacity of the model. The issue of\n",
    "underfitting is usually addressed by giving the model as much complexity\n",
    "as is possible and necessary to reduce the bias of the model, in order\n",
    "to ensure that the model is able to represent the desired function in\n",
    "principle. Then, overfitting is prevented by using a well chosen prior\n",
    "to reduce the variance of the fitted model. Non-Bayesian machine\n",
    "learning techniques often arbitrarily introduce mechanisms to constrain\n",
    "model complexity such as weight penalties; these techniques are\n",
    "unnecessary in the Bayesian paradigm due to the effect of prior\n",
    "distributions, which are in some cases equivalent to weight penalties.\n",
    "Bootstrapping (averaging over maximum likelihood models trained on\n",
