# Introduction

## Motivation

### Uncertainty in engineering simulation

Since the advent of the computer, engineering simulation has become an
invaluable tool for the design and analysis of systems. Simulation
allows engineers to bridge the gap between theoretical models of systems
and empirical evidence, whilst making predictions about yet to be
constructed systems {cite}`patelliopencossan`. Some important applications of
this include structural engineering {cite}`sundararajan2012probabilistic`,
aeronautical structures {cite}`sundararajan2012probabilistic`, and petroleum
reservoir engineering {cite}`Sadeghi_2018`.

The engineer's theoretical model of the system's physics can be defined
by a mathematical function or a more complex simulation, and this
theoretical model will depend upon associated parameters which determine
the specific properties of the system under consideration. The physical
model to be used may be motivated by the engineer's expert judgement, or
prescribed by a relevant design standard document. Provided the model's
parameters are known, the model can be used to make predictions about
the system. In some cases, e.g. well known material properties, the
parameters to be used will also be prescribed by the design standard
document. If this is not the case, the engineer must identify these
parameters from data or expert judgement. Hence, in many realistic
situations these parameters will not be known exactly, and therefore
will be associated with some uncertainty. If the system is not well
understood, then the theoretical model of the system's physics may
itself be uncertain. However, in many cases this situation can be dealt
with by adding more uncertain parameters to the model, thereby
increasing the model's degrees of freedom. This uncertainty will be
reflected in the predictions made by the model, hence the ability of the
system to meet some specified objective, e.g. safe operation, now
becomes uncertain. In essence, this motivates the well known structural
reliability analysis problem, where we wish to calculate the probability
that the system under uncertainty doesn't meet a specified objective,
which is referred to as the failure probability of the system
{cite}`melchers2018structural`.

### Reliability engineering

Researchers in the discipline of reliability engineering have proposed
many techniques to solve the reliability analysis problem. Most
generally, Monte Carlo simulation can solve any reliability analysis
problem with arbitrary accuracy, given sufficient samples of the
uncertain system parameters and evaluations of the system model
{cite}`melchers2018structural`. If the failure probability of the system is
small, which is typical in most realistic engineering problems, then the
number of model evaluations required increases significantly, and
creates a bottleneck to the calculation. Therefore, in practice, more
efficient methods are required to solve the reliability analysis problem
for expensive computational models with many inputs. These include
approximate methods, e.g. the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and
advanced simulation techniques, e.g. line sampling, which require fewer
samples of the system model
{cite}`sundararajan2012probabilistic` {cite}`de2015efficient`.

Alternatively, since the cost of the analysis depends strongly upon the
cost of evaluating the system model, one may attempt to replace the
expensive system model with a cheaper surrogate, known as a metamodel.
This metamodel is usually obtained by using machine learning
technologies to learn a function which is a sufficiently accurate
representation of the true model. Well known metamodels applied in
reliability engineering include neural networks, response surfaces
(polynomial regression), polynomial chaos, and Kriging (Gaussian process
emulators)
{cite}`sundararajan2012probabilistic` {cite}`schobi2017surrogate` {cite}`gomes`. If the
metamodel is inaccurate then this can introduce additional uncertainty
into the calculation, and typically this must be traded off against time
required to create the metamodel. In any case, the uncertainty in the
metamodel should be quantified and its influence on the failure
probability of the system stated. As such, the problem is challenging
and does not yet have an entirely satisfactory solution, although
significant progress has been made in recent years.

### Models of uncertainty

Many techniques exist for modelling uncertainty, and therefore the
chosen uncertainty model is also, to an extent, an engineering
judgement. This judgement is usually based on the type of uncertainty
being modelled, and usually two types of uncertainty are considered;
epistemic uncertainty and aleatory uncertainty
{cite}`gal2016uncertainty` {cite}`de2015efficient`. Broadly speaking, epistemic
uncertainty represents uncertainty which originates from a lack of
knowledge, and aleatory uncertainty represents uncertainty which
originates from natural variability, i.e. stochasticity.[^1] Again, some
guidelines are available in design standards or regulations, for example
the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission often suggests using
Bayesian probability theory {cite}`us2009guidance` {cite}`nureg2201`.

Bayesian probability theory is a logically consistent method of
reasoning under uncertainty, though it has been shown to lack empirical
justification in some circumstances, e.g. {cite}`balch2017satellite`. Efficient
computational methods exist to identify many probabilistic models for
uncertain variables in the Bayesian paradigm, in addition to convenient
analytic techniques {cite}`jaynes2003probability`. In recent decades, several
extensions to the traditional probabilistic models for uncertainty have
been proposed, e.g. Dempster-Shafter Theory, probability boxes, and
random sets {cite}`de2015efficient` {cite}`sandia2002constructing` (often referred
to as specific manifestations of *imprecise probabilities*). These
methods enable reasoning with imprecise data and a severe lack of prior
information.

Imprecise data consists of data where each measurement is not specified
by a real number (sometimes referred to as crisp measurements), but
instead the data falls within certain bounds which can be characterised.
Scarce data refers to the case where insufficient data is available to
accurately identify an unknown model parameter. Therefore our knowledge
of the parameter places undue weight on our prior belief about the
parameter. In such cases an engineer may wish to check the sensitivity
of their model's predictions to the chosen prior, and it is therefore
essential that the engineer can accurately represent uncertainty in
their prior belief about a parameter
{cite}`berger1984robust` {cite}`berger1994overview`. Crucially, imprecise
probabilities offer a method of reasoning with uncertainty which is more
flexible and hence requires fewer assumptions than traditional
probabilistic methods.

Despite these advantages, working with imprecise probabilities in
practice introduces some new difficulties. Since the uncertainty model
is more complex, the computational techniques required to perform
computations are also more complex. Typically, this computation involves
some optimisation in addition to the already expensive Monte Carlo
simulation {cite}`de2015efficient`. Hence, in recent years, researchers have
described techniques to solve the reliability analysis problem with
imprecise probability models which apply similar approximations to those
used in the straightforward probabilistic case.

Structure of this Book
------------------------

The topics discussed in the previous section will be addressed in the following three chapters.

Chapter {ref}`ch:uncertainty_models` reviews uncertainty models, i.e.
models describing the uncertainty in a variable, or set of variables. We
review techniques to construct these models from data, and expert
opinion, and describe techniques for converting between common models.
This chapter describes probability boxes in detail, and shows how
traditional probability distributions emerge as a particular case of a
probability box.

Chapter {ref}`ch:machine_learning` reviews machine learning techniques for
creating regression models, which are used as metamodels in engineering.
Regression models differ from the uncertainty models described in
Chapter {ref}`ch:uncertainty_models`, as they model the behaviour of a
uncertain variable which depends on the behaviour of another variable.
In this chapter, the theory behind interval predictor models is
described in detail, and compared to traditional techniques in
statistical learning.

Chapter {ref}`ch:reliability_analysis` describes the well known
reliability analysis problem in engineering, where one wishes to
calculate the probability that the performance of a system under the
influence of uncertainty meets a particular design condition.
State-of-the-art techniques for efficiently solving this problem with
random variables and probability box variables are reviewed.

[^1]: Note that in some cases this distinction is unclear. For example
    when a very simple model is used for the behaviour of a coin, the
    outcome of the coin flip may appear to be random. However, one could
    imagine a situation where the kinematics of the coin can be
    simulated exactly using Newton's laws of mechanics, and the only
    uncertainty in the outcome of the coin flip is caused by lack of
    knowledge in the coin's initial position and velocity. Chaotic
    systems (e.g. the Lorenz attractor), where the future evolution of
    the system depends strongly on the initial conditions, may appear to
    be random, for example when the model considered for the system is
    insufficiently detailed and the initial conditions are not known
    with sufficient accuracy.
