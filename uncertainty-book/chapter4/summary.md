## Chapter summary

In this chapter we reviewed the application of the uncertainty models
introduced in
{ref}`ch:uncertainty_models` to the field of reliability
engineering. Specifically, this chapter demonstrated how probabilistic,
set-based and imprecise probability models can be used to calculate the
reliability of systems under uncertainty. The optimal design of a system
under uncertainty can also be computed, and the local or global
sensitivity of the response of a system to changes in the system
variables can be determined. For systems where the probability of
failure is small, computing the failure probability using a Monte Carlo
estimator can be computationally expensive. For this reason, it is
necessary to apply advanced techniques in order to calculate the
probability of failure in a feasible computational time. For imprecise
probability models, computation of the failure probability of the system
is even more expensive, and hence efficient computational techniques are
also required. This motivates the novel contributions introduced in the
following chapters.
