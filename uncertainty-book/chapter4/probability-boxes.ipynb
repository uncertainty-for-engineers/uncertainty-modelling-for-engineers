    "\n",
    "A Monte Carlo estimator can be applied for the integrals in the failure\n",
    "probability computation with distribution-free probability boxes\n",

    "A generalisation of FORM for systems with components which are described\n",
    "by probability boxes was introduced by {cite}`qiu_probabilistic_2008`. The\n",
    "system's performance function must be written in the load resistance\n",
    "form\n",

    "$\\mu_R\\in[\\underline{\\mu_R}, \\overline{\\mu_R}]$ and standard deviation\n",
    "$\\sigma_R\\in[\\underline{\\sigma_R}, \\overline{\\sigma_R}]$, and load\n",

    "In more complex cases, one may need to solve an optimisation program to\n",

    "of probability box distributed variables falls below a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Line sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite}`de2015efficient` describes two ways in which Line Sampling can be used\n",
    "to increase the efficiency of probability box propagation. Line Sampling\n",
    "can be applied as an alternative to the Monte Carlo estimator used to\n",
    "approximate the integral in the double loop approach\n",
    "({eq}`eqn:pf-impreciseL` and\n",
    "{eq}`eqn:pf-impreciseU`). Alternatively, Line Sampling can be\n",

    "and lower performance functions in\n",
    "{eq}`eqn:random-set-lower` and\n",
    "{eq}`eqn:random-set-upper`. When Line Sampling is applied in the\n",
    "aleatory space, the importance direction updating strategy proposed by\n",
    "{cite}`de2015efficient` significantly increases the accuracy of the\n",
    "computation. Judged by number of samples required for computation, Line\n",
    "Sampling is close to the state of the art. However, Line Sampling is\n",
    "ineffective on highly non-linear limit state surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The Importance Sampling estimator in\n",
    "{eq}`eqn:importance-sampling` can be applied to greatly reduce\n",
    "the number of samples required when computing the failure probability\n",
    "for a system subject to probability box random variables\n",
    "{cite}`fetz2016imprecise`. The bounds on the failure probability are given by\n",

    "where the samples ${\\boldsymbol{x}}^{(i)}$ are drawn from the proposal\n",
    "distribution $h(\\boldsymbol{x})$. The proposal distribution can be\n",
    "iteratively updated to provide more accurate results. {cite}`decadt2019monte`\n",
    "demonstrates that the bias in both cases is negative and decreases in\n",
    "magnitude as more samples are collected. The Importance Sampling\n",
    "estimator requires a similar number of samples to Line Sampling.\n",

    "#### Multi level metamodels\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilevel Metamodelling requires the creation of two Gaussian Process\n",
    "emulators {cite}`schobi2017structural`. The first metamodel is created for\n",
    "the performance function in the space of the system variables\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{x}$, using Adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo simulation. The\n",
    "second metamodel is used to perform Bayesian Optimisation on the\n",
    "obtained failure probability from the first metamodel, in the epistemic\n",
    "space. This greatly reduces the amount of repeated similar evaluations\n",
    "of the system model, and hence the Multi-level metamodelling technique\n",
    "is close to state of the art when judged by number of required samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval Predictor Models\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite}`sadeghi2020robust` uses an IPM as a metamodel to propagate probability boxes.\n",
    "In the first two algorithms, the performance function is modelled as a function with unknown noise structure in the aleatory space and supplemented by a modified performance function. \n",
    "In the third algorithm, an Interval Predictor Model is constructed and a re-weighting strategy used to find bounds on the probability of failure. "
