# Uncertainty Modelling for Engineers
 
**How to use this book**

This book is intended to serve as a practical introduction to uncertainty quantification for engineers.
It is intended to be particularly useful for those beginning a graduate course of study.
Basic concepts are explained in detail, and relevant literature is summarised for more advanced concepts.
After reading the book and studying the worked examples you should be able to implement a basic uncertainty quantification workflow.

The text of the book is largely adapted from {cite}`sadeghi2020uncertainty`.

I have included interactive code examples in python. Where possible the code examples use primitive python datatypes and commonly used packages for clarity.
 
**How to make a contribution**

If you are making a major change you may first wish to discuss the change by opening a GitHub issue.

You should fork the repository and make your desired changes to the files locally.
Once this is done you can preview your changes locally by running `jupyter-book build uncertainty-book/` in the project directory.
Do not commit the output files from the build process.
You may have to install the project requirements, if you have not already done so.
Once you are happy with your changes you should commit and push your changes, then make a pull request which we can review.
