How to use this book
====================

This book is intended to serve as a practical introduction to uncertainty quantification for engineers.
It is intended to be particularly useful for those beginning a graduate course of study.
Basic concepts are explained in detail, and relevant literature is summarised for more advanced concepts.
After reading the book and studying the worked examples you should be able to implement a basic uncertainty quantification workflow.

The text of the book is largely adapted from {cite}`sadeghi2020uncertainty`.

I have included interactive code examples in python. Where possible the code examples use primitive python datatypes and commonly used packages for clarity.
